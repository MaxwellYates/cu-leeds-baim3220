For CU students taking BAIM-3220 at Leeds School of Business

N.B. for students: These are empty notebooks. For filled-in work, typealongs, and examples that we've discussed in class, look to the current class details in Canvas. I've put many weeks of notebooks from a prior instructor in here. Please be aware that these can and will change.

_With many thanks to Prof. McGee for assembling all of the first cuts of these notebooks._
