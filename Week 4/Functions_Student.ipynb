    ">>- If you find yourself duplicating code that is usually a cue that you could write a function to be more efficient in your code\n",
    ">- One of the strengths of Python is that people are continually creating functions for various tasks\n",
    ">>- Many people rely on various Python modules with built-in functions to write  code\n",
    ">>- However, there could be instances where you would need to create your own functions\n",

    "### Some Function Basic Notes and \"Talking\" Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"Calling\" a function is when you write the function in your code: print(), input(), etc are \"calls\" to these functions \n",
    "2. \"Passing\" in values, called arguments, is when you input something into the function. For example: \n",
    ">- In general: print(*argument*) \n",
    ">- A specific argument: print('Hello World')\n",
    ">>- Here we are \"calling\" the print function and \"passing\" the value/argument 'Hello World' into it\n",

    "4. But if a variable is used in a function but not in an assignment statement, it is a global variable. \n",
